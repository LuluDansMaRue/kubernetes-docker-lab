# Kubernetes Docker experiments ðŸŽ‹

## Introduction

Welcome fan of Bubble tea.

This project is for people who are curious and want to learn how to deploy an application from A to B to several environements such as: 

- Docker for your development environment
- Minikube for emuling your Kubernetes production environment
- Kubernetes for your production environment on GCloud

Throughout this guide we'll learn several thing which are describe in the table of contents below

## Objectives âœ…

At the end of this project you should be able to get a good grasp on Docker, Kubernetes and GCloud.

Below are the objectives that we should have reach

```
- Be able to deploy an app on Docker
- Understand the architecture of Kubernetes
- Understand the difference between Kubernetes & Docker Swarm
- Know how to use minikube for local prototyping
- Know how to deploy a web app from A to B with kubernetes within GCloud
- Understand when & how to scale a cluster on multiple pods & on several timezone.
- Be able to add an other service to an existing GCloud product (e.g: GCloud SQL) 
- Be able to understand & implement a deamon, service & side-car (e.g: Cloud SQL Proxy)
- Understand & know how to deploy a load balancer
- Be able to know implement a monitoring process by using stackdriver & grafana.
- Create Cron task on GCloud 
```

## Enjoy ! ðŸŽŽ
