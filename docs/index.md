# Kubernetes Docker experiments ðŸŽ‹

## Introduction

Welcome fan of Bubble tea.

This project is for people who are curious and want to learn how to deploy an application from A to B to several environements such as: 

- Docker for your development environment
- Minikube for emuling your Kubernetes production environment
- Kubernetes for your production environment on GCloud

Throughout this guide we'll learn several thing which are describe in the table of contents below

## Table of contents

* [Architecture](architecture.md)
* [Deployment](deployment.md)
* [Service](services.md)
* [Persistent volume](storage.md)
* [Cron task](cron.md)
* [Minikube](minikube.md)
* [Example with Minikube](deployment/example.md)
* * [Front deployment](deployment/front.md)
* * [API deployment](deployment/api.md)
* * [Service front deployment](deployment/service_front.md)
* * [Service API deployment](deployment/service_api.md)
* * [Database](deployment/database.md)
* * [Deploying on GCP]()


## Objectives âœ…

At the end of this project you should be able to get a good grasp on Docker, Kubernetes and GCloud.

Below are the objectives that we should have reach

```
- Be able to deploy an app on Docker
- Understand the architecture of Kubernetes
- Understand the difference between Kubernetes & Docker Swarm
- Know how to use minikube for local prototyping
- Know how to deploy a web app from A to B with kubernetes within GCloud
- Understand when & how to scale a cluster on multiple pods & on several timezone.
- Be able to add an other service to an existing GCloud product (e.g: GCloud SQL) 
- Be able to understand & implement a deamon, service & side-car (e.g: Cloud SQL Proxy)
- Understand & know how to deploy a load balancer
- Be able to know implement a monitoring process by using stackdriver & grafana.
- Create Cron task on GCloud 
```

## Enjoy ! ðŸŽŽ
