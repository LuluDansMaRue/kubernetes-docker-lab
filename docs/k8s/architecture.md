# Architecture

In this page we will take a quick look at the internal architecture of Kubernetes. This will allow us to understand the different components of this containarized deployment services.

## Type of architecture

Kubernetes is a master-slave architecture centric service. A master-slave architecture is a kind of architecture where the main process has the control of all the other child process.

Within Kubernetes we have a set of **master components** which will give instruction to the **nodes components**. The **master components** are regarded as the master and the **nodes components** act as the slaves

## Components

Understanding kubernetes components will allow you to better understand what happened behind. First we will see the **master components**. Later on the **child component**

### Master components

#### api server

#### etcd

#### controller-manager

#### scheduler

### Child components
