# Front deployment description

Deploying an application to Kubernetes required you several things

- kubectl
- minikube
- a docker image
- a yaml deployment configuration file

# Building our Docker image

For the sake of the demo a Dockerfile.release is available in the ```build/front/``` folder. This Dockerfile doesn't differ that much from the original dockerfile. It just add the project to the Dockerfile.

First of all from the root of the folder run this command

```shell
docker build -t sesame_front -f build/node/Dockerfile.release <path to root folder>/kubernetes-docker-lab
```

What this command does ?

- We ask docker to build an image
- -t we provide the name in this case sesame_front
- -f We're providing the context of building the dockerfile. In this case from the root folder

Once the image is build run the command ```docker images```. and you should see the docker image available in the list of images like below.

# Create the deployment configuration

As we said earlier we will use the type ```deployment``` for deploying our front. Let's do it !

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
# This is the type of deployment we talked earlier
kind: Deployment
# Defining metadata allow us to recognize our application easily (can be use by external tools such as Stackdriver, kubectl)
metadata:
  # Name of your deployment
  name: bobba-vue
  # A set of identifier that can help you to identify the pods
  labels:
    app: bobba-vue
    tier: frontend
# Spec is where you are configuring your deployment
spec:
  # number of replicas
  replicas: 2
  # Selector is use for the deployment to apply to the pod
  # Using matchLabels it must match at least one of the label defined earlier
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: bobba-vue
    # Definition of your pod here
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: bobba-vue
      spec:
        containers:
          - name: bobba-vue
            image: sesame_front:latest
            # This line enabled us to use a local image and not to fetch one coming from a server
            imagePullPolicy: Never
            # Expose the container port to the cluster
            ports:
              - containerPort: 8080
            # a list of arguments that you can use at the startup of your pods
            args:
              - sh
              - start.sh
```

The file is available in the ```k8s/deployment/front_deployment.yml```

# Deploying our application to Minikube

Now that we have our yaml configuration file and our docker image. Let's deploy our app. Run the following command

```shell
kubectl create -f k8s/deployment/front_deployment.yml
```

Secondly listen the deployment status of the pod

```shell
kubectl rollout status deployment.v1.apps/bobba-vue
```

You should get a success message that said that your deployment is successfull. 

Finally check if your pod are running by using the command

```shell
kubectl get pods
```

Et voil√† you made your first deployment !

## Error

If you have any error you can check the event status of your pods by running this command.

```shell
# Get the list of available pods
kubectl get pods

# Get the event of a pod
kubectl describe pod <pod_name>

# Now look at the events section (should be at the end)
# You could also check the pod's log by running this command
kubectl logs -p <pod_name>

# if the pod is killed you could get the logs of a pod like this too
kubectl logs <pod_name>
```
